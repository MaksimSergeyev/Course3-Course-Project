# Course3-Course-Project
This repo contains my submission for the course project for Course 3 getting and cleaning data

I began by reading in all of the various files into the variables described below. I then merged each set for the three variables into a single set for each variable. I then extracted the columns containing mean and st. dev values. I then set activity names using activites as a factor. I then added more detailed names to replace the abbreviated names. I then extracted the data using subject as a factor.

The variable names are described in the Code Book.
